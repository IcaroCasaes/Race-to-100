# Race-to-100

Making race to 100 game work using some dice functionalities

The game is a 1v1 competitive race that consists of accumulate points up to 100 using the D6 simulator.

How it works:

-On your turn the players must either roll the dice or hold their current score.

-If they hold, the Current Score will be added to the Total Score and that player passes the turn to the other one.

-If they roll a number bigger than 1, the value is added to the Current Score.

-If they roll a 1, the Current Score resets and that player passes the turn to the other one.
